\section{Introduction}
My name is Suad Alhojely. I am married and I have a lovely daughter her name is Miral. I am a PhD student here at UCCS in Computer Science and I am from Saudi Arabia. It is clear that I came from oversea to seek knowledge and learning. It is my second semester, but it is my first actual semester because I enrolled this semester for full time student. While the last semester I was enrolled for part time student cause I had some immigration issue, I am so excited but nervous and worried. I believe this semester will be tough because I took 9 credits for the financial aids requirement, but I will do my best in order to get good grades. I chose to take the Computer Science Research because I am planning to write papers during my studying period here at UCCS. In my master degree I did two publications. I still remember how I felt when I publish my first paper. It was an amazing feeling. I am willing to feel that feeling again and again. Also, I want to learn new techniques and skills for writing a paper. Moreover, I am interested in deep learning under the supervision of my advisor, Prof. Kalita.

\section{git repo}



This is a link to my github repository for this document.


\href{https://github.com/BoultClasses/CS-Research1.git}{This is the link}.

I have joined to BoultClass and the I create a new repository.Then, i will import the code in GitHub.

\subsection{Body}
I downloaded Latex, which is using for writing papers, and assignment. Then I use Overleaf tool, which is online tool that support Latex. It is for writing and publishing paper in easier and nicer way. I started writing what require from me. It is not difficult but it needs time to understand the tool. The difficult part was how to connect  source code between GitHub and Overleaf. Also, 
I install Zotero, which is reference management tool for free, but in my assignment I add my references by Overleaf.


\section{My interest in research }
  I am interested in deep learning and sentiment analysis. For this assignment, I chose sentiment analysis in Twitter.  sentiment analysis determine the attitude of people under three categories: positive, negative and neutral. It obtain high accuracy on classifying sentiment in social Media like Twitter messages using machine learning techniques.
  
  However, 

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. This equation from citation 4.  
\[Accuracy = \frac{TN + TP }{TN + TP + FP + FN }
      \]
      The equation above is indicator which computed using confusion matrix about the performance of sentiment techniques.
